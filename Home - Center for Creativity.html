          <h2 id="our-story" class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
          <p>Behind this effort is a passionate group of community leaders and artists working hard to make this dream a reality. Our journey began in 2010 with the formation of ARTS RWC, a collective of artists, art advocates, organizations, and civic leaders dedicated to advancing Redwood City as a dynamic and sustainable arts community. In 2022, we took a significant step by establishing a formal Steering Committee. The role of our committee is to conduct research, develop plans, and rally support for a permanent facility in San Mateo County: The Center for Creativity. Since then, our Steering Committee has engaged civic leaders, raised funds, and conducted a feasibility study to assess our community’s need for a permanent arts center. The feasibility study aimed to inform decisions about the center’s activities, location, size, and overall operations. In 2023 the feasibility study was completed, and the Steering Committee is now in the process of socializing our results and working within our community to raise support for the center. We have many community partners engaged in our efforts for a permanent arts center.</p>
